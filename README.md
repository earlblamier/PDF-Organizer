- **Reports:**
  - `Data_log_<date>.csv`: Logs details of processed pages.  
  - `Report_<date>.csv`: Summary of processed PDFs, including record counts and total images.  
  - `Group_page_counts_<date>.csv`: Grouped page counts with total images and records.  
- **Merged PDFs:** Combined PDFs for each group.

---

* Key Functions  
1. **pageData**  
   Extracts and groups pages from PDF files into a DataFrame and organizes them into folders.

2. **extractPages**  
   Processes PDF files, groups pages, and creates blank PDFs for odd-numbered groups.

3. **processFilesPdf**  
   Processes PDF files and organizes them into folders based on page tags.

4. **createReport**  
   Generates a CSV report summarizing the processed PDFs.

5. **mergePdf**  
   Merges grouped PDF files into a single PDF for each group.

---

* Example Workflow  
1. Place your PDF files in the directory.  
2. Run the script and provide the required inputs.  
3. The script will:  
   - Extract and group pages.  
   - Create blank pages for odd-numbered groups.  
   - Organize PDFs into folders.  
   - Generate reports.  
   - Merge grouped PDFs into single files.

---

* Known Issues  
- **Blank PDF Creation:** A race condition may occur when creating the first blank PDF file during long processes.  
- **File Locking:** Ensure CSV files are not open in another program while running the script.
